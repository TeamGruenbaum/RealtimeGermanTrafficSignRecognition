# RealtimeGermanTrafficSignRecognition

## Introduction
This repository contains the backend, the frontend and the scientific paper in German of the project **RealtimeGermanTrafficSignRecognition**. The backend, developed in Python, localizes and identifies traffic signs in real time, where you can choose between two different object recognition methods. The ORB algorithm from OpenCV as a traditional analysis method and YOLO as a machine learning method are used for object recognition. The frontend, an Android app, uses the backend by highlighting traffic signs in a live camera preview. The scientific paper goes into more detail about the background and implementation and also compaires ORB and YOLO with each other.
<br>
The project was created during our Master‘s programme at Hof University of Applied Sciences in the lecture „Data Mining and Machine Learning“.
